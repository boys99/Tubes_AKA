The management task system currently under development assists users in organizing their work based on priorities and time constraints. We conduct an analysis to evaluate the performance of iterative and recursive algorithms in two key operations:  1. Linear Search (both recursive and iterative) 2. Bubble Sort (both iterative and recursive)
